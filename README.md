# Sepsis Event Log Analysis

Process Mining 2024

This repository stores the code for the analysis of the handling of patients suspected of sepsis in one of
the Dutch hospitals. Sepsis is the bodyâ€™s extreme response to an infection and is poten-
tially life-threatening. According to the authors of the original project, process mining
can provide vast insights into the trajectory of patients in a hospital and verify whether
the daily clinical practice follows medical guidelines.
